Hotfix Branches: Sometimes, critical bugs or issues arise in the production environment that need immediate attention. Hotfix branches are created directly from the main branch to address these issues. Once fixed, the changes are merged both into the main branch and the development branch to ensure the fixes are present in future releases.
