## Usage

To use this applcation, please visit [insert link here].

Users will be greeted by the landing page of the application; a simple site with a nav bar, and a "Search" button on the middle left-hand side of the page.

Click on the button to start the search process for recipes. A modal will pop up with an input bar for keywords, and three dropdown menus.

Users will need to use **at least one** of the following search criteria:
In the input bar, users may enter key words or phrases to base the search off of (Ex. "Chicken," "Tacos," "Ramen," etc.)
The Meal Type dropdown lets users specify which category of meal the recipe will fall under (Ex. "Breakfast, Lunch/Dinner")
The Dish Type is an optional dropdown that lets users further specify what kind of food the recipes will be (Ex. "Pasta," "Salad," "Soup")
The Cuisine Type dropdown lets users specify which culture/country the dish originates from (Ex. "Italian," "American," "Asian")

Once at least one of these parameters has been filled out, users will then hit the "Search!" button in the modal. From there, the API will be sent a request with the various parameters/criteria as specified by the user. Once the request is complete, various cards will then be populated in a new modal with various recipes, along with images of each. Users can then select a button to view the recipe on how to make the dish, select a button to view restaurants with that dish in their area, or save that recipe to their favorites (saved under local storage).
